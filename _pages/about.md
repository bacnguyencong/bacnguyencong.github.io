I am a Research Scientist at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/) working on core deep generative modeling. I received my PhD from Ghent University in 2019, where I worked on a supervised learning problem, called metric learning. Given some supervision information, the goal is to learn from examples a distance function that measures how similar or related two objects are. During my Ph.D., I developed various large-scale optimization techniques for distance metric learning problems under different types of supervision.
