I am a Research Scientist at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/) specializing in Generative AI and Foundation Models. My work spans multiple domains--including computer vision, speech, and natural language processing--with a current focus on enhancing the efficiency and scalability of deep generative models. I am particularly interested in reducing training costs, accelerating inference, and optimizing large-scale foundation models for real-world impact.

Previously, I obtained my PhD from [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) in 2019, co-advised by [Carlos Morell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qJhOnsUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [De Baets Bernard](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-iWALUsAAAAJ&hl=en). My PhD research focused on a supervised learning problem, called metric learning. Given some supervision information, the goal is to learn from examples a distance function that measures how similar or related two objects are. During my Ph.D., I developed various large-scale optimization techniques for distance metric learning problems under different types of supervision.
