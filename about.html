		My name is Bac Nguyen Cong. I am a research scientist at Sony AI. My research includes deep learning in Computer Vision and Generative Modelling. I received my PhD from <a href="https://www.ugent.be/en">Ghent University</a> in 2019, where I worked on a supervised learning problem, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_learning#Metric_learning">metric learning</a>. Given some supervision information, the goal is to learn from examples a distance function that measures how similar or related two objects are. During my Ph.D., I developed various large-scale optimization techniques for distance metric learning problems under different types of supervision.
