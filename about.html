		My name is Bac Nguyen Cong. I am a research scientist at Sony AI Speech and Sound Group (AISSG), R&D Center Europe Stuttgart Laboratory 1. My research includes deep learning in Computer Vision and Generative Modelling. I received my PhD from Ghent University in 2019, where I worked on a supervised learning problem, called “distance metric learning.” Given some supervision information, the goal is to learn from examples a distance function that measures how similar or related two objects are. During my Ph.D., I developed various large-scale optimization techniques for distance metric learning problems under different types of supervision.
